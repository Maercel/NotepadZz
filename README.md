# NotepadZz 📖
Notepad application build with Qt framework that includes a feature to **search through** the text.

# Why did I write this text editor? ❓
I recently started with Qt development, and this is my first Qt project. 
During development of **NotepadZz** I learned a lot, but I believe there is still a lot more to learn. 

I will not be replacing it with my other text editors, since it's too simple. 

# How to Use the Search Feature 🔎
To initiate a text search, press **CTRL + F** and enter the word you're looking to find.

# Project Outlook 🔭
This may be the final version of **NotepadZz** due to other commitments. However, the experience has been amazing, and I look forward to creating more **advanced applications** in Qt and other languages.

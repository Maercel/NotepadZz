# NotepadZz
Notepad application build with Qt framework that includes a feature to **search through** the text.

# Why did I write this text editor?
I recently started with Qt development, and this is my first Qt project. 
During development of **NotepadZz** I learned a lot, but I believe there is still a lot more to learn. 

I will not be replacing it with my other text editors, since it's too simple.

To start searching text click **CTRL + F** and type desired word to find.

# Summary
This is probably the final version, due to the work that I will be doing, but I am looking forward to developing even better text editors and desktop applications.
